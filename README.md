# rmssp_benchmark
The benchmark instances are generated for evaluating the performance. The combinations of machines and jobs are set as *M*´*N* = {{5,8,10,15}´{10,15,20}}, yielding 12 problem size. For each combination, 5 test instances are randomly generated, resulting in 60 instances. The number of optional configurations per machine follows a uniform distribution *U*[2,3]. The number of operations per job is drawn from *U*[0.75*m*,1.25*m*], where *m* is the number of machines. The probability of an operation being processable on a specific machine-configuration combination is 0.5. The processing time *pj*,*i*,*k*,*c* is sampled from *U*[10,99], and the machine reconfiguration time *rt**k*,*c*1,*c*2 follows *U*[50, 100].
